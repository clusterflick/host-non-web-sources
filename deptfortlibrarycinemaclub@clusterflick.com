Film Schedule for January – Forgotten Blockbusters

The screenings are all free to attend and open to all. There is no need to book a ticket (unless otherwise stated), just turn up!

Run Lola Run

Tom Tykwer – 1998 – 1H21M – Cert. 15

Thursday 8th January – 6:00pm

After her boyfriend botches a money delivery, Lola has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 Deutschmarks in order to save his life. Following Lola in real time, the film explores the themes of fate and chance by offering three different versions of the allotted twenty minutes – each one radically different depending on one small decision Lola makes.
Run Lola Run was a huge box office success on its release, especially in it’s home country of Germany. Like every good blockbuster, the film also left an indelible mark on various media released in its wake, inspiring multiple video games and music videos of the late 90s and early 2000s, and of course securing a reference in The Simpsons. Perhaps because it is so steeply entrenched in the aesthetic of the time, Run Lola Run seems to have fallen out of the current cinematic zeitgeist, despite being re-released in select US theatres for its 25th anniversary last year. It’s also not available on streaming platforms in the UK, so if you’d like to watch this hidden gem then come on down to Deptford Library!

Nomadland

Chloé Zhao – 2020 – 1H47M – Cert. 12

Thursday 15th January – 6:00pm

After the company she worked for shuts down, a widower in her sixties gives up her home and embarks on a journey through the western United States to live as a van-dwelling nomad. She soon meets and bonds with fellow nomads who teach her survival and self-sufficiency skills for the road. Nomadland went on to dominate its respective award season, as well as setting multiple records with Zhao becoming the first Asian woman (and only the second woman full stop) to win Best Director at the Academy Awards, and Frances McDormand becoming the first person to win Academy Awards as both producer and performer for the same film. Although the film was technically a commercial success (it’s gross revenue far exceeded its relatively low production budget of $5 million), due to the Covid restrictions at the time, it remains the lowest grossing Best Picture winner in decades. Consequently, like many films released at the time, Nomadland remains a criminally under-watched piece of cinema.

Heavenly Creatures

Peter Jackson – 1994 – 1H39M – Cert. 18

Thursday 22nd January – 6:00pm

Based on the notorious real-life Palker-Hulme murder case, Heavenly Creatures follows precocious teenager Juliet after she moves to New Zealand with her family, soon befriending the quiet, brooding Pauline through their shared love of fantasy and literature. This friendship gradually develops into an intense and obsessive bond, with terrible consequences. I will admit calling this film a blockbuster is slightly dubious, (though it did do well at the box office and got a smattering of award noms and wins), but I’m giving it a pass because it was directed by Jackson right before he would arguably go on to become one of the reigning masters of the blockbuster. It also became the star vehicle for Kate Winslet, as well as Melanie Lynskey (who I would argue is also a criminally underrated actress – if you’ve seen Yellowjackets you’ll know what I mean).

Discussion Group

Thursday 29th January – 6:00-7:00pm

Come and discuss this month’s screenings in an informal and relaxed setting with fellow film enthusiasts. There’s no requirement to have attended any/all of the screenings, just come along for a biscuit and a chat!

Chef

Jon Favreau – 2014 – 1H54M – Cert. 15

Friday 30th January – 2:00pm

When Chef Carl Casper suddenly quits his job at a prominent Los Angeles restaurant after refusing to compromise his creative integrity for its controlling owner, he is left to figure out what’s next. Finding himself in Miami, he teams up with his ex-wife, his friend and his son to launch a food truck. Taking to the road, Chef Carl goes back to his roots to reignite his passion for the kitchen – and zest for life and love. Again, this film is technically an indie, but was made by another Blockbuster giant Jon Favreau, straight off the back of directing the Iron Man movies. Favreau’s big Hollywood status also allowed him to pull in some huge names for the film, including Robert Downey Jr, Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson and Sofia Vergara. This film has definitely cemented its status as a cult favourite in the food world (Chef walked so that FX’s The Bear could run), and has been praised by food critics and restaurateurs alike for its realistic depiction of the culinary world. Cinematically, however, the film has not received enough credit – although be warned, it will make you hungry!

This screening is a collaboration between The Albany’s Meet Me At club for over 60’s. The film is scheduled at an earlier time for greater accessibility, but is open to everyone just like every other screening!

Now you know this month’s films – fancy doing an introduction?

If you’d like to introduce any of the films this month please complete this short form. <https://forms.office.com/e/7VqGiNnuCr>

The purpose of this cinema club has always been to help connect local film fans, and celebrate our love of cinema as a group. I know we have some very passionate and knowledgeable members out there, so don’t be shy! You don’t have to have any experience of public speaking, and I will be there to support on the day.

Intro guidelines:

• the intro can be anywhere between 1-10 minutes in length
• you can have a script or you can improvise – whatever works best for you
• it’s always good to mention the film’s title, director and time of release to familiarise the audience, but otherwise the focus can be up to you. You can do a general introduction to the film, giving some context to the time it was released and information about the film’s director and production, or you can focus on a particular aspect of the film, such as the music or the cinematography
If you have any questions, please do get in touch <mailto:madeleine.davies%40lewisham.gov.uk>
